# Trunk of crap (dotfiles?)

## Don't trust blindly (if at all), I've barely tested running make except for manjaro, so use only as a prototype.

## The directories with a '.' should be copied into home directory, then stowed.

## The stow command `stow --restow 'ls -d */'` will only stow non-dot directories in the current directory stow is run in.

## The 'dotfiles' will all be migrated to submodules, currently only the .manjaro directory is a submodule.

### Have fun, and thanks to all the people who I borrowed from :D
