## Don't trust blindly. This is mostly tested Manjaro, so use only as a prototype.

## The directories with a '.' should be copied into home directory if desired to be used, then stowed.

## The stow command `stow --restow 'ls -d */'` will only stow non-dot directories in the current directory stow is run in.

### Have fun, and thanks to all the people who I borrowed from :D
